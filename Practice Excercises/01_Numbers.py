# # Numbers and more in Python!
# 
# In this lecture, we will learn about numbers in Python and how to use them.
# 
# We'll learn about the following topics:
# 
#     1.) Types of Numbers in Python
#     2.) Basic Arithmetic
#     3.) Differences between classic division and floor division
#     4.) Object Assignment in Python

# ## Types of numbers
# 
# Python has various "types" of numbers (numeric literals). We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.
# 
# Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.
# 
# Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.
# 
# Throughout this course we will be mainly working with integers or simple float number types.
# 
# Here is a table of the two main types we will spend most of our time working with some examples:


#  
#  
# Now let's start with some basic arithmetic.

# ### Basic Arithmetic

# In[1]:


# Addition
2+1


# In[2]:


# Subtraction
2-1


# In[3]:


# Multiplication
2*2


# In[4]:


# Division
3/2


# In[5]:


# Floor Division
7//4


# **Whoa! What just happened? Last time I checked, 7 divided by 4 equals 1.75 not 1!**
# 
# The reason we get this result is because we are using "*floor*" division. The // operator (two forward slashes) truncates the decimal without rounding, and returns an integer result.

# **So what if we just want the remainder after division?**

# In[6]:


# Modulo
7%4


# 4 goes into 7 once, with a remainder of 3. The % operator returns the remainder after division.

# ### Arithmetic continued

# In[7]:


# Powers
2**3


# In[8]:


# Can also do roots this way
4**0.5


# In[9]:


# Order of Operations followed in Python
2 + 10 * 10 + 3


# In[10]:


# Can use parentheses to specify orders
(2+10) * (10+3)


# ## Variable Assignments
# 
# Now that we've seen how to use numbers in Python as a calculator let's see how we can assign names and create variables.
# 
# We use a single equals sign to assign labels to variables. Let's see a few examples of how we can do this.

# In[11]:


# Let's create an object called "a" and assign it the number 5
a = 5


# Now if I call *a* in my Python script, Python will treat it as the number 5.

# In[12]:


# Adding the objects
a+a


# What happens on reassignment? Will Python let us write it over?

# In[13]:


# Reassignment
a = 10


# In[14]:


# Check
a


# Yes! Python allows you to write over assigned variable names. We can also use the variables themselves when doing the reassignment. Here is an example of what I mean:

# In[15]:


# Check
a


# In[16]:


# Use A to redefine A
a = a + a


# In[17]:


# Check 
a


# The names you use when creating these labels need to follow a few rules:
# 
#     1. Names can not start with a number.
#     2. There can be no spaces in the name, use _ instead.
#     3. Can't use any of these symbols :'",<>/?|\()!@#$%^&*~-+
#     4. It's considered best practice (PEP8) that names are lowercase.
#     5. Avoid using the characters 'l' (lowercase letter el), 'O' (uppercase letter oh), 
#        or 'I' (uppercase letter eye) as single character variable names.
#     6. Avoid using words that have special meaning in Python like "list" and "str"
# 
# 
# Using variable names can be a very useful way to keep track of different variables in Python. For example:

# In[18]:


# Use object names to keep better track of what's going on in your code!
my_income = 100

tax_rate = 0.1

my_taxes = my_income*tax_rate


# In[19]:


# Show my taxes!
my_taxes


# So what have we learned? We learned some of the basics of numbers in Python. We also learned how to do arithmetic and use Python as a basic calculator. We then wrapped it up with learning about Variable Assignment in Python.
# 
# Up next we'll learn about Strings!
